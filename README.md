You quickly grab your coat and run to the elevatot, but it's too late: Everyone in the hospital is already infected!

## Installation
You need to have Python Version 3.6+ and a compatible version of pip installed on your system. We recommend downloading a stable realease from the official Python Website: [Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) / [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

To further install all the required packages for the game, navigate your command line to the repository and run following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note that this installs the required packages into your global python installation. If you want to install packages into a virtual environment instead, follow [these](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) steps.

Once you've followed the above steps, you are ready to play Sneaky Doctor!

## How to play
To run the game, navigate your command line to the repository and run following command:

```
python3 main.py

From the main menu you can now start a new game.
